# 30 Days of JavaScript

## Description
This repository is to document my thoughts and what I learn taking Wes Bos' [30 Days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. 

## Installation and Usage
Each day of the challenge is in it's own folder. You can download this repository from my github [here](https://github.com/rlfuller/30-days-javascript) and download or clone to your computer. Each solution is html, css and javascript files. To run any given exercise, simply launch the html file in a browser.
